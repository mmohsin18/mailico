Title: How to Use Mailico: A Developer-First Email Workflow
Slug: how-to-use-mailico
Date: 2025-12-02
Excerpt: A practical guide to sending, tracking, and scaling email with Mailico.

Mailico is built for teams who want clarity over complexity when sending email.
Whether you’re shipping transactional emails, onboarding flows, or product updates, Mailico keeps the workflow intentional and debuggable.

This guide walks through how to use Mailico end-to-end — from setup to sending your first email, and then scaling responsibly.

1. Setting Up Your Workspace

Mailico is workspace-centric. Each workspace represents a product, startup, or environment (e.g. staging vs production).
Once you create a workspace, you can:
- Configure sender identities
- Store API credentials securely
- Manage audiences and campaigns in isolation

This keeps environments clean and prevents accidental cross-sending.

2. Connecting Your Email Provider

Mailico doesn’t replace email infrastructure — it orchestrates it.

You connect your provider (such as Resend) by adding an API key once. Mailico encrypts and stores it securely, then uses it to send on your behalf. Why this matters:
- No vendor lock-in
- You keep ownership of your email reputation
- Switching providers doesn’t require rewriting workflows

3. Sending Your First Email

There are two primary ways to send email with Mailico:
Dashboard
- Compose a message
- Choose recipients
- Send immediately or schedule

Ideal for:
- Product updates
- Announcements
- One-off communication

API
- Send emails programmatically
- Trigger sends from product events
- Use Mailico as an email layer inside your app

This makes Mailico suitable for both non-technical teams and engineers.

4. Understanding Campaigns & Logs

Every send in Mailico generates structured logs.
You can see:
- When an email was sent
- Who it was sent to
- Delivery status
- Errors (if any)
Instead of abstract analytics, Mailico focuses on operational visibility — the kind developers actually need when something goes wrong.

5. Webhooks & Event Awareness

Mailico exposes webhook events so your app can react to email lifecycle changes.
Examples:
- Mark onboarding complete when a welcome email is delivered
- Retry flows when a send fails
- Sync email activity back to your database
This turns email from a side-effect into a first-class system.

6. Scaling Without Losing Control

As volume grows, Mailico helps you scale deliberately:
- Separate environments
- Controlled sender identities
- Clear audit trails
- Predictable workflows
The goal isn’t to send more email — it’s to send the right email, intentionally.

Closing Thoughts
Mailico is designed as an email coordination layer, not a bloated marketing suite.

If you care about:
- Developer experience
- Clean workflows
- Transparent email behavior
Mailico fits naturally into your stack.
